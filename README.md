I intend to maintain this fork of [alexcesaro/statsd](https://github.com/alexcesaro/statsd) for the foreseeable future,
as I use this library in my own projects. Backwards compatibility is my highest priority. I did attempt to look for
existing maintained forks, but the few I investigated all made breaking changes. I will be adding new features, but
only when I have an immediate use case, and I will do my best to keep to the spirit of the original implementation.

No releases but `master` will remain stableâ„¢.

**Changelog**

* 2020-11-13 - Added the SafeConn write closer that checks if the connection is still up before attempting to write

* 2020-08-27 - Fixed bug in `statsd.Tags` identified by https://github.com/alexcesaro/statsd/issues/41

* 2019-05-22 - Added support for arbitrary output streams via new `statsd.WriteCloser` option

* 2019-05-22 - Added support for simplified inline flush logic via new `statsd.InlineFlush` option

* 2019-05-26 - Fixed bug causing trailing newlines to be removed for streaming (non-udp) connections
